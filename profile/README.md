<h2 align="center">How to contribute -Step by Step Guidelines 🛣️ </h2>

Do you think any of your favourite feature is missing? if yes, you can add it and make it beautiful experience for all.

We are excited to invite you to contribute in this community and make it better.

If you want to contribute, then follows the guidelines mentioned below.

**1.**  Fork the repository.

**2.**  Clone your forked copy of the project.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/BuildersChain-community.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.
```
   cd BuildersChain-community
```

**4.** Create a new branch:
```
   git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```
   git add .
   git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repository.

```
   git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a pull request to the upstream repository.

**9.** Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added More Content! #3453".

**10.** Explain the changes you made, any problems you believe the pull request has, and any queries you have for the maintainer in the description of the pull request. No pull request is flawless, so it's okay if yours isn't too; the reviewer will be able to assist you in fixing any issues and making improvements.

**11.** Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.

**12.** Congratulations! Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!💜😁🚀
